# AI-Enabled-car-parking-System
Car parking is a common problem faced by drivers in busy urban areas. For example, imagine you are driving to a shopping mall during peak hours. As you approach the mall, you notice that the parking lot is full, and several other cars are circling around looking for available spots.

You join the queue of cars, hoping to find an available spot soon. However, as time passes, you realize that the parking lot is overcrowded, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to find a spot. You start to feel frustrated and anxious, knowing that you might be late for your appointment or miss out on a great shopping opportunity.

AI-enabled car parking using OpenCV is a computer vision-based project that aims to automate the parking process. The project involves developing an intelligent system that can identify empty parking spaces and give the count of available parking spots.

The system uses a camera and OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) library to capture live video footage of the parking lot.

## Architecture:

### To complete this project you must have the following software versions and packages.


●	VScode (https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

●	Python (Download: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/ )

●	opencv-python

●	cvzone

●	flask

## Project Flow:


●	Data Collection o Download the video

●	Video Processing and object detection o Import required libraries o Checking for parking space o Looping the video o Frame processing and empty parking slot counters

●	Application building o Build HTML

o	Build python script for Flask

For this project, we have created 5 HTML files and saved them in the templates folder. Let’s see what HTML pages look like:

## main page: 
It contains the home page button(CarCrush), About us, About Project, and upload button where you can upload your video(for the same scenario) and check how many slots are empty/full.
